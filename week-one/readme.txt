Image classifier using the tensorflow.js Javascript library along with the MobileNet model. Tutorial provided at 

https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/transfer/image_classification

Usage: Put/Clone index.html and index.js in a local folder, and open index.html with a browser that can handle HTML5 video 
(latest Chrome or Firefox will do, Safari probably not). If you are not on a laptop, attach a webcam to you computer before. 
Initializing may take a few seconds, and also you might be asked to allow the browser to use your webcam. Once you get a moving
picture, play around with gestures or obcects that you hold into the camera, and for each gesture/object, click on one of the
three buttons, to assign them a propper value. After the first click, the system will start predicting, and puts the result above 
the image. The more you train it, the more accurate the predictions will become.

Have fun!
